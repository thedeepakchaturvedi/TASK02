## DOM Manipulation: Counter and Timer

In this example you will be creating a simple timer and counter application using DOM manipulation techniques.
The structure here represents the folder structure that will be used in the application.

```
.
├── index.html
├── readme.md
├── src
│   ├── app.js
│   ├── counter
│   │   ├── counter.js
│   │   └── counterReadMe.md
│   └── timer
│       ├── timer.js
│       └── timerReadMe.md
└── style
    ├── counter.css
    ├── style.css
    └── timer.css
```

'app.js' is the main application file that will work on displaying the contents on index.html file.
'counter.js' will build a counter component and timer.js :hourglass: will build a timer component
Styling and UI is left up to the developer to choose. Let the choice be functional and self explanatory.

The main application UI can have a check box for selecting the application to be displayed
Based on the check-box selection the relevant application will be displayed on DOM.
